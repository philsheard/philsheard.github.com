Here's what my blogging flow looks like these days:

I start writing something on the laptop, phone or iPad. Ideas continue to strike in the least likely places so being able to start writing almost anywhere (online or offline) is a massive plus point.

Programs I'm using the most:
- Mobile I'll either use iA Writer on iPhone / iPad or Epistle on Android. Both do a good job of getting out of the way, let me use Markdown for formatting and give a preview of what's been done so far.
- Laptop - it's either iA Writer for OSX when I want to sit down and write seriously, or often I'll just use Sublime Text to start off a new thought.
