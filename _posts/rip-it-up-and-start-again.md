I've been working in digital comms for a few years and the last few have focused largely on the promise and application of social media. We started as users, hooked on the possibilities, and found ways to factor this into businesses day to day.

Today our heroes are starting to become lost to us. Twitter, Facebook, all these places that were once the bastions of the future are acting more and more like the businesses of days gone by. Bloggers have up their sites and switched their attentions to other places. Now everyone has been divided and conquered. 

Is the potential still there?
