title: World leaders on Twitter, eh?

Spotted [this][1] on TechCrunch today: number of world leaders using Twitter has grown to 75% from 42% a year ago.

Great news! Twitter is brilliant for breaking down boundaries and connecting public figures with their, well, publics. It's inspiring to see world leaders embracing new ways of communicating, cutting out the middleman and connecting directly through social networks.

It's a shame that the top two mentioned by TC haven't posted a single @reply on the first page of their results.

**Obama**

**Chavez**

Well, it's no good if there's no conversation. Such a missed opportunity.
